It is possible to condition the table in the kitchen room in AI2-THOR to have specific objects placed on it for your manipulation tasks.

You can achieve this by programmatically placing objects on the table before you start the task, using AI2-THOR's APIs to set up the environment. Here's how you can do it:

# Example to spawn objects on the table
controller = ai2thor.controller.Controller()

# Load the kitchen scene with a table
controller.reset('Kitchen1') # Or 'Kitchen2' depending on your preference

# Specify object names and positions on the table
controller.spawn_object('Cup', position={"x": 0.5, "y": 0.1, "z": 0.5})
controller.spawn_object('Plate', position={"x": 0.7, "y": 0.1, "z": 0.3})
controller.spawn_object('Knife', position={"x": 0.8, "y": 0.1, "z": 0.1})
